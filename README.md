I did not focus on any particular browser but instead went for as much compatibility as possible. 

For my project I wanted to look at earthquakes and see how I can manipulate the information and display it in an easy to understand way.The API I used is from the US Government. It provides information on over 600 earthquakes that have happened around the world. It includes information about the location, magnitude, depth, and more. This information is organized as a set of features that allow us to sort and filter the earthquakes. This specific data  contains earthquakes that occured between Jan 1st, 2020 and Jan 2nd, 2020. When it comes to the visualization that my project uses it is solely the map showing where the earthquakes occured. This uses the Leaflet JS library. For my CSS I used the thing we learned in class. Things such as containers and flex boxes, header and footer styles and more. My project is trying to show information about earthquakes and having a way to manipulate the data and make it easy to understand.
