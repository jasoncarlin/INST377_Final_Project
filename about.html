                For my project I wanted to look at earthquakes and see how I can
                manipulate the information and display it in an easy to understand
                way.<br><br>
                The API I used is from the  <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&starttime=2020-01-01&endtime=2020-01-02">US Government</a>.
                It provides information on over 600 earthquakes that have happened
                around the world. It includes information about the location, magnitude, 
                depth, and more. This information is organized as a set of features
                that allow us to sort and filter the earthquakes. This specific data 
                contains earthquakes that occured between Jan 1st, 2020 and Jan 2nd,
                2020. <br><br>
                When it comes to the visualization that my project uses it is solely 
                the map showing where the earthquakes occured. This uses the 
                Leaflet JS library. For my CSS I used the thing we learned in 
                class. Things such as containers and flex boxes, header and footer 
                styles and more. My project is trying to show information about 
                earthquakes and having a way to manipulate the data and make it 
                easy to understand.
